# OrgAPP
I started Coding in January 2020, and started with SWIFT in March 2020.
I created this "Project Organisation App" for learning purpose.

I just started with Git, thats why there are no previos branches or commits.

There may be a bunch of "RealmSwift" stuff laying arround.
Just switched from internal storage to Firebase - so cleaning is in Process.

// CAREFULL ;)
CleanCode reworking in Process:
I am aware that my Code is not that 100% Clean.
Still optimizing and applying new learned stuff to improve the structure of the Code. :)
